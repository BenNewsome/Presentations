ES4 Presentation

This is a presentation made with impress.js

It is a 10 minute presentation on current research project.

The idea is to make a poster that comes alive with the power of javascript.

TO-DO
==================

Everything...

Import the impress.js template and get it to run

Create a poster

Get the poster to have decent sections that can be talked about.

Idealy for a 10 minute poster, I would want about 10 slides. So yea...
